 #Hashing data structure 
Hashing data structure is the process of mapping a large amount of data to a smaller value using a hashing function and the    value is stored in a hash table.

A hash function takes a group of characters called a key and maps it to a value of a certain length called a hash value it is usally got by the formular:
                x= key % length of the hash table
                x is the hash value
                
A data table then can be described as a data structure that basically maps keys to values

In the notebook we see that we start by creating an empty table in form of an array, this table has a length of 10 

 Then we formulate our hash function with the above formular and we see that when we put in some keys we generate hash values.
 
 These hash values
